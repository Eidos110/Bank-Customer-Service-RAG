## 📦 Installation & Setup  

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- 8GB+ RAM recommended
- 10GB+ free disk space for model downloads
- Internet connection for initial setup

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Eidos110/banking-customer-service.git
cd banking-customer-service

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the application
python run.py
```
## 🎯 Usage Examples 
### Web Interface 

The application provides an intuitive web interface with: 

- Real-time question answering
- Example question suggestions
- System status monitoring
- Mobile-responsive design

### API Endpoints 
The system provides RESTful API endpoints for integration:
```bash
# Query the RAG system
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are your banking hours?"}'

# Check system status
curl http://localhost:5000/api/system-info

# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

### Example Queries
```bash
# Banking hours
"What are your branch operating hours?"

# Account management
"How do I reset my online banking password?"

# Card services
"What should I do if my card is lost or stolen?"

# Transactions
"What are the fees for international transactions?"
```

## 🔧 Performance Optimization 
### Memory Management 

- Automatic GPU/CPU selection
- Cache clearing mechanisms
- Memory-efficient model loading
     
### Response Time 

- Vector database caching
- Context-aware chunking
- Optimized retrieval pipeline

## 🛡️ Security Considerations 
- Data Privacy: All processing occurs locally
- No External Dependencies: Self-contained system
- Input Validation: Sanitized user inputs
- Error Handling: Graceful error responses
     
## 🐛 Troubleshooting 
### Common Issues 

- CUDA Errors: Switch to CPU mode by modifying the device_map in rag_system.py 
- Memory Issues: Reduce max_new_tokens in configuration or use quantized models 
- Model Loading Failures: Check internet connectivity for initial downloads 

### System Requirements 
- Minimum: 4GB RAM, 5GB disk space
- Recommended: 8GB RAM, 10GB disk space
- Optimal: 16GB RAM, GPU acceleration

## 📈 Roadmap 
### Short Term

- Add support for custom knowledge base uploads
- Implement conversation history
- Add multi-language support
     
### Long Term

- Integrate with live agent handoff
- Add sentiment analysis
- Implement feedback learning loop
